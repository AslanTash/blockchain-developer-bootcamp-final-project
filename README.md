## Decentralized Slot Machine - 99% payout
Without a central authority to compensate, a slot machine can be built on the blockchain with a 99%+ payout. Slot machines in Las Vegas have a payout of 82% - 95%. This low payout is required in order to generate enough revenue to maintain physical buildings, slot machines, various attractions and more.
Moving forward I would like to improve the front end and add more variety to the game.

## Flows
- Spin flow: you enter an amount and spin the wheel. You are rewarded if you get a winning combination.
- Stake flow: you can stake some of your SLOTS tokens to gain membership benefits.
    - None: your winnings multiplier is .96
    - Bronze (10,000): your winnings multiplier is .97
    - Silver (100,000): your winnings multiplier is .98
    - Gold (1,000,000): your winnings multiplier is .99
